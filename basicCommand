man <command> to get the manual:

ls to list all the files inside the folder

ls/bin to print folder content

bin prints folder content so that all contents csn be seen

once u hve a folder, you can move into it using the cd command. cd means change directory. You invoke it specifying a folder to move into. You can specify a folder name, or an entire path.

Whenever you feel lost in the filesystem, call the pwd command to know where you are: it prints out current folder path
